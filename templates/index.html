Votes are used to generate various ordered displays of archive records&mdash;e.g., by general popularity (net votes), popularity within subdisciplines, percentage of upvotes vs. downvotes, etc. The archive is intended to help philosophers find those works most relevant to their research or interests, and members are therefore expected to vote on the basis of the quality and contributory value of the work in question. By default, all reviews, both quantitative and qualitative, are anonymous. (Editors can tell that two reviews come from the same member, but not who that member is.)

If necessary, other features of Wikipedia will be adopted, such as editorial oversight to flag controversy (e.g., if a wiki is being edited back and forth in certain ways).

<td>Populus will periodically publish a volume of its journal (also called Populus). The projected publication schedule is quarterly or biannual. Unlike a traditional journal, conditional acceptance (think 'pending final review' for an edited volume) is a direct function of the quantitative review system. The function is expected to evolve over time. However, initially, it will simply output the <a href="javascript:;" id="toggle" data-tabname="pxxxxxsef">submissions</a> with the highest ratio of upvotes to downvotes, beyond a minimum number of total votes and a minimum vote ratio. Conditionally accepted works will then go through an expedited version of a more traditional review process. An appropriate referee will be asked to review the work and make a recommendation as to whether it should be published as-is or revised. Reviewers can also reject papers, but the expectation is that this will be rare, as there is a presumption in favor of publication on the basis of member votes. It should go without saying that members are also expected to be both charitable and respectful in editing the review wiki.</td>

<p>Populus seeks to improve academic publishing by capitalizing on the advantages of the Internet. Some of these improvements concern things like price and access; others concern the integrity of the review process and its ability to track quality. Many of the former and some of the latter issues have been addressed by the recent development of open source, online journals. However, unlike such earlier projects, which have exported traditional publishing models to the Internet, Populus is a completely new kind of publication venue, aiming to provide markedly better experiences in <a href="javascript:;" id="toggle" data-tabname="brvxxx">publishing</a>, <a href="javascript:;" id="toggle" data-tabname="rbvxxx">reviewing</a>, and <a href="javascript:;" id="toggle" data-tabname="vbrxxx">archiving</a>.</p>

<td>With Populus, there is no uncertainty regarding the timeline for review. Works are eligible for conditional acceptance at the deadline for each journal issue after submission, so long as they are flagged as journal submissions. What's more, authors have access to real-time feedback on their work. They are able to see at all times whether their work is being read and how it is being received, both in terms of votes and feedback on the wiki. Is your work getting less upvotes than you'd like? Are there comments in the wiki you believe you can address? Simply address them and upload a new version.</td>

<td>The hope is that philosophers will see reviewing works on Populus as a duty of citizenship within the philosophical community, much as many do now when asked to referee for other publication venues. However, because the review process relies most heavily on votes, reviewing for Populus is less arduous than reviewing for other journals. If there is a paper you are interested in reading, there is little cost to reading it through Populus and voting. Populus will also incorporate game-like incentives, such as status boosts (e.g., 'top reviewer'). It is TBD whether these will be purely symbolic or will come with tangible incentives, such as additional voting power.</td>

<td>The hope is that this will be the exception, rather than the rule. One reason for hope is that the desirability of being published in Populus depends on the journal's reputation. If members vote as worried here, without regard to quality, Populus' reputation is unlikely to be good, thus undercutting the incentive to vote this way in the first place. There is therefore good reason to vote properly not only for the sake of personal integrity, but also to preserve the integrity of Populus itself. Of course, there will probably be some who vote as worried here. But the same is true in the traditional peer review system. One of the hopes behind crowd-sourcing is that the overall results will remain reflect the better nature of the majority. There are doubtless many who leave insincere or self-serving reviews on (e.g.) Amazon. But in the best cases, the ratings systems on such sites nevertheless provide useful information to users.</td>

<td>That depends on a lot of things including, most importantly, you. Participation from the philosophical community will be indispensable to Populus' success. There are plenty of other potential worries, many surrounding how well crowd-sourced reviews will track quality. But as suggested above, the relevant question is not whether the Populus model is ideal, but whether it is better than the status quo and other feasible alternatives. Whether that is the case can only be determined through experimentation. Crucially, Populus is not a static experiment. Members are encouraged to offer suggestions regarding changes in editorial policy, and in the long run, the data itself may make recommendations. Suppose, for example, a correlation is found between the works upvoted by reviewers with certain profiles and those works' impact factor. Perhaps reviewers with those profiles will be given additional voting power, either permanently or for a special issue.</td>
